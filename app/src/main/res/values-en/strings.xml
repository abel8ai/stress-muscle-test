    <string name="orientaciones_para_aplicar_los_tests1">GUIDELINES TO APPLY THE TESTS</string>
    <string name="antes_de_aplicar_los_test_el_evaluado_debe">Before applying the tests, the evaluated must:</string>
    <string name="orientacion1">1. Carry out the general and special warm-up.</string>
    <string name="orientacion2">2. In each test, the fullness of the proper posture for the test must be respected (see figure by test) and the established methodology.</string>
    <string name="orientacion3">3. The test is finished when the subject varies or modifies the appropriate posture for the test (see figure for test) or settles in a different position.</string>
    <string name="orientacion4">4. A break between tests of 5 to 10 min is established.</string>
    <string name="orientacion5">5. Block I tests are applied one day first in the order in which they have tests from 1 to 4.</string>
    <string name="orientacion6">6. On a second day, the Block II tests are applied in the order in which they have tests 1 and 2.</string>
    <string name="orientacion7">7. On a third day, the Block III tests are applied in the order in which they have tests from 1 to 3.</string>
    <string name="orientacion8">8. With pain, injury and/or operation, none of the tests are performed.</string>
    <string name="orientacion9">9. Tests can be applied every 7, 15 or 30 days.</string>
    <string name="orientacion10">10. If the aim is to determine the test-retest reliability of the tests in a population group, each test must be repeated at least 3 times with rest periods between 5 and 7 days to perform the same test again.</string>
    <string name="orientacion11">11. The recommended thing is to rest from 24 to 48 hours to apply the tests (Block I rest 24 to 48 hours, Block II rest 24 to 48 hours, Block III rest 24 to 48 hours and I can apply any other type of test).</string>
